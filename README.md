# Would You Rather

"Would You Rather?" is a React web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

This app is the second of three projects required for [Udacity's React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).
